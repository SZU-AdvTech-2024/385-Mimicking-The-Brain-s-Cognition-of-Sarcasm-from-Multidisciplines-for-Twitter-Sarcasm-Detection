Unfortunately, the computer hung early in the boot-up process.\n\n#### Body:\n- The user mentions that they were unable to capture the text on the screen, so they took a picture with their phone. Unfortunately, the text appears to be below, but it is not visible in the image.\n\n#### Technical Advice:\n- The user suggests changing the `sdon-inverted` attribute in the device tree. This attribute is used to detect the SD card, but for some reason, it cannot read partitions on it.\n- The user also mentions that the screen brightness issue is related to a change in the default contrast value for the `wm8650+` driver, which supports RGB565 (which only supports ARGB8888). They suggest working around it by editing the file drivers/video/fbdev/wm8505fb.c and changing `0x10` to `0x80` in the line that says `fbi->contrast = 0x10;`.\n\n### Analysis and Description\n\n#### Brightness and Screen Contrast:\n- The user mentions that the screen brightness is not as bright as it should be, which is 1/8 of what it should be. This suggests that the screen contrast might be too low, which could be affecting the brightness perception.\n- The user suggests changing the `sdon-inverted` attribute in the device tree, which is used to detect the SD card. However, this attribute cannot read partitions on the SD card, indicating a potential issue with the SD card itself or the partitioning process.\n- The user also mentions a change in the default contrast value for the `wm8650+` driver, which supports RGB565 (which only supports ARGB8888). This suggests that the screen brightness issue might be related to a change in the default contrast value for the driver.\n- The user suggests working around the issue by editing the file drivers/video/fbdev/wm8505fb.c and changing the value in the line `fbi->contrast = 0x10;`. This line is likely related to the contrast settings for the driver, and changing it to `0x80` might help improve the brightness perception.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe user is experiencing a brightness and screen contrast issue, which is related to the default contrast value for the `wm8650+` driver. By changing the value in the file drivers/video/fbdev/wm8505fb.c, the user can potentially improve the brightness perception on the screen.",

    "821867046757695488": "The image is a list titled \"#Blackout Recommendations\" which provides guidelines for how to engage with a show or series during a blackout period. The list is divided into two main sections: \"What Not To Do\" and \"What To Do.\"\n\n### What Not To Do\n1. **Do Not Watch Live or On Any Official Platforms**\n2. **Do Not Follow @JRothenbergTV and @cwthe100 or the writers and producers**\n3. **Do Not Link to or Share or Click on Articles Clearly Promoting the Show**\n4. **Do Not Watch Teasers or Promos or Trailers or Use the Official #The100 Hashtag**\n5. **Do Not Discuss General Episode Content or Current Characters on Show Day**\n\n### What To Do\n1. **Do Keep Talking About Lexa and Clexa Using Correct Spelling**\n2. **Do Continue to Use Lexa and Clexa Hashtags to Stay Visible and Relevant (It's Not Promo)**\n3. **Do Continue to Respond to and Name Tag Writers, etc. to Let Them Know Your Critical Opinion**\n4. **Do Continue to Vote in Lexa and Clexa Relevant Polls (think Lexa/Clexa vs. The 100)**\n5. **Do Continue to Leave Critical Reviews and Rate the Show on IMDB, Netflix, etc.**\n6. **Do Spread the Word on Twitter, Other Social Media Platforms, Word of Mouth, etc.**\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The list mentions that without going into in-depth about Nielsen Social Content Ratings, their daily and weekly charts only cover the overall number of unique accounts and original posts along with the engagement during the show and 3 hours before and after. These metrics do not only take into account the official show handle and hashtag but also include characters, talent, and related phrases, etc. Nielsen's comprehensive measurement service however provides both the TV industry and advertisers with much more detailed metrics, including keyword and sentiment analysis. This means that while Lexa and Clexa may be picked up and counted towards their daily and weekly charts if used during the show and 3 hours before and after, the more detailed metrics will show how significant and how the conversation about Lexa and Clexa still is and whether the sentiment is positive or negative towards the show.\n\n- The following is much MORE IMPORTANT:\n  - Without our negative feedback, all that is left to read about the show on social media will be positive and mostly Bellarke-centric (rating on IMDb also gives the show a necessary evil).\n  - Without us talking about Lexa and Clexa, all that is left to find about them are negative comments or nothing at all, which will make them irrelevant and possibly ruin any chances for a spinoff (no searchable/measurable Lexa mentions suggests nobody is interested in her anymore).\n  - Any critical article raises awareness about and provides coverage for the show but is absolutely vital to have published and shared to provide the necessary balance to promotional articles. Same goes for our tweets; the buzz they create is necessary because without our critical point of view, it would tell an unbalanced, incomplete story favoring the show! The show will not be renewed solely based on overall mentions and general buzz still surrounding it.\n\n### Analysis\nThe list provides clear guidelines for how to engage with a show during a blackout period, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a critical perspective and engaging with the show through various channels. It suggests that while positive mentions are important, critical feedback is equally crucial for the show's future. The guidelines also highlight the importance of using hashtags and engaging with writers and producers to maintain a dialogue and critical opinion.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe image serves as a practical guide for fans and media professionals during a blackout period, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a critical perspective and engaging with the show through various channels. The list provides clear guidelines for how to do this effectively, ensuring that the show remains relevant and critical to the audience's understanding.",
