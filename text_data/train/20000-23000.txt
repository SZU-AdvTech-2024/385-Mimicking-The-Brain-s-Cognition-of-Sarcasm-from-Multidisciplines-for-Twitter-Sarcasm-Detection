This was the year of peak TV or as my mom, who's Indian by the way, might say, \"(extremely racist and stereotypical Indian voice:) I do not own a television set. I sold it so I could buy a new flute to play for my cobra.\"\n\n(wait for standing ovation)\n\nI see \"Mr. Robot\" is here tonight. Did you know the original name for Mr. Robot was (extremely Arnold Schwarzenegger voice) \"Mr. Robotinator.\" And every time they cut to commercial he was going to say \"I'll be back!\" You know, like in \"The Terminator\" movies?\n\n(wait for the rapture)\n\n\"The Good Place\" was my favorite show of the year but here's a question for ya: Why didn't they just call HEAVEN?!?!?\n\n(wait for heads to explode)\n\nI'm getting the light so it's time for my big closer... did anyone see \"Atlanta\" this year? What a terrific show, it's about black people and rapping. They also smoke pot on that show. So maybe they should have called it \"Badlanta.\" I said maybe they should have called it \"Badlanta\".... so, I'm half Indian and half Japanese, so when I open a fortune cookie, my parents expect a perfect score on my SAT's.\n\nI DRIVE A TESLA. Enjoy the show, you friggin' idiots!\n\n---\n\nThis monologue is a mix of humor, social commentary, and personal anecdotes, making it a memorable and engaging performance at the Golden Globe Awards."}

Here is the transcription of the note:\n\n---\n\n**Failing**\n- Temporary\n- A setback/disappointment\n- Shows you are stretching yourself + pushing limits\n- Part of the journey\n- Opportunity to learn + grow\n\n**Being a Failure**\n- Permanent\n- A mindset\n- Shows you have given up\n- End of the journey\n- Turning your back on learning + growth\n\n---\n\n### Analysis and Description:\n\n1. **Failing**:\n   - **Temporary**: The note acknowledges that failing is a temporary state. It suggests that failure is not a permanent state but rather a temporary setback or disappointment.\n   - **A setback/disappointment**: This implies that failure is not just a negative experience but also a learning opportunity.\n   - **Shows you are stretching yourself + pushing limits**: The note highlights that failure is a way to push oneself beyond comfort zones and learn new skills.\n   - **Part of the journey**: It acknowledges that failure is a part of the journey, which is a natural part of personal growth and development.\n   - **Opportunity to learn + grow**: The note emphasizes that failure provides an opportunity to learn and grow, which is crucial for personal development.\n\n2. **Being a Failure**:\n   - **Permanent**: The note suggests that being a failure is not a permanent state. It implies that failure is not a lifelong condition but rather a temporary state.\n   - **A mindset**: The note uses the term \"mindset\" to describe the mindset one should have after experiencing failure. It suggests that one should not view failure as a permanent state but as a temporary setback.\n   - **Shows you have given up**: The note implies that failure is not a permanent state because it does not mean giving up.\n   - **End of the journey**: The note suggests that failure is not the end of the journey but rather a temporary setback that leads to a new journey.\n   - **Turning your back on learning + growth**: The note encourages turning one's back on failure and instead focusing on learning and growth, which is a crucial aspect of personal development.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe note provides a nuanced understanding of failure and being a failure, emphasizing that failure is not a permanent state but a temporary setback that can lead to personal growth and development. It encourages a positive mindset towards failure, emphasizing the importance of learning from it and turning one's back on it."}

Open a dictionary at a random page and choose a word. It doesn\u2019t have to make much sense. Eg: Immolate, Juice, or Bravado.\n2. Think of a strapline which tells your customers nothing about what you do, in a short, twee, friendly way. \u201cWe make brands feel fizzy.\u201d\n3. Create a wacky \u201cMeet the team\u201d page. Include useless facts about your staff. Include quirky photos. Basically anything that\u2019ll make customers not want to actually meet your team.\n4. Talk incessantly about \u201cour brand\u201d and \u201cstorytelling\u201d and \u201csocial\u201d.\n5. Work from a slightly run-down, open-plan office in an up-and-coming part of town. Hang a bike on the wall. (Must be exposed brick.) Purchase some really uncomfortable, colourful, and abstract furniture.\n6. Have a \u201cbreakout\u201d room and a piece of novelty sporting equipment such as a football table or pinball machine. And a mini beer fridge.\n7. Buy a shitload of Macs and put stickers on them!\n8. Hire some web developers, but call them \u201crockstars\u201d or \u201cninjas\u201d.\n9. Have more directors than actual working staff. All directors must wear thick, black-rimmed, designer glasses. And brown shoes. With blue jeans.\n10. Just have loads of fun ideas! Scatter toys around the office!\n11. Tweet absolute regurgitated tedium to your 34 followers.\n12. Follow every single design, social, and marketing trend. Just like every other goddamn creative agency in the entire world ever.\n13. Pretend you are a Don Draper-esque ad man by drinking a large scotch before meetings. But the reality is, you\u2019ll vomit in a wire mesh bin, and fall asleep on the toilet by 3pm.\n\n---\n\nThis guide is a playful take on starting a creative agency, with a focus on making it seem like a fun and creative process, despite the seemingly absurd and unrealistic steps."}

The poster is divided into two main sections: \"Winter weather\" and \"Winter car safety for drivers.\"\n\n### Winter Weather Section\n- **Snow**: Falling snow reduces visibility, so always switch on your dipped headlights. Lack of adhesion can occur even on treated roads, so drive slowly in the highest gear possible, manoeuvre gently, and avoid harsh braking.\n- **Ice**: It is often difficult to see ice on the road. If you suspect the road surface is covered in ice, it is essential to do everything more carefully than normal. Slow down, steer gently, and avoid harsh braking.\n- **Rain**: Heavy rain will reduce visibility, particularly from vehicle spray. Always use your dipped headlights and reduce speed. At night, wet conditions worsen the glare from headlights so again, slow down.\n- **Hail**: Hail can occur unexpectedly; slow down and use dipped headlights. After a hailstorm, the road surface will be slippery so drive carefully.\n- **Fog**: In fog, drive very slowly using dipped headlights. When visibility is seriously reduced, reduce speed to below 100 metres (328 feet) and use front and rear fog lamps. Remember to switch them off when visibility improves. Use your windscreen wipers and demisters to improve visibility. Drive at a speed that will allow you to stop within the distance you can see clearly. Do not hang on to the tail lights of the vehicle in front as it can give a false sense of security. When you slow down, use your brakes so that your brake lights warn drivers behind you. When 'Fog' is shown on a roadside signal but the road appears to be clear, be prepared for a bank of fog ahead. Fog can drift rapidly and is often patchy.\n\n### Winter Car Safety for Drivers Section\n- **Are you ready for winter?** It is getting frosty in the mornings as the colder weather approaches. This is the time to prepare for the winter months and to think about how to keep yourself and others safer on the roads.\n- **Plan your journey** Before setting out on a journey during winter weather conditions, make the following checks:\n  - Is the journey absolutely necessary?\n  - Check the local and national weather forecasts.\n  - Obtain travel information and road conditions from local and national radio.\n  - Ensure that the vehicle has a full tank of fuel.\n  - Give an estimated time of arrival at your proposed location.\n- **Weather warnings** If you are going away, check the weather forecast for your destination, along the route, and for your return journey. It is always best to check the weather warnings before travel and not to travel on any journeys that are not necessary if there are severe or adverse weather warnings. You can check the latest weather warnings at www.metoffice.gov.uk.\n\n### Additional Information\n- **British weather can vary considerably over a very short period of time and distance. Winter can often strike suddenly and severely leaving motorists unprepared for the conditions.**\n- **Snow**: Falling snow reduces visibility, so always switch on your dipped headlights. Lack of adhesion can occur even on treated roads, so drive slowly in the highest gear possible, manoeuvre gently, and avoid harsh braking.\n- **Ice**: It is often difficult to see ice on the road. If you suspect the road surface is covered in ice, it is essential to do everything more carefully than normal.

Here's a detailed description:\n\n1. **Top Section:**\n   - The top section has a green background with a globe icon and the text \"EARTH\" at the top.\n   - Below the globe icon, there is a blue banner with the text \"EARTH, TREES, ANIM\" in white text.\n\n2. **Middle Section:**\n   - The middle section has a light green background with a pattern of various illustrations.\n   - There are several text boxes with different actions or events listed.\n     - \"EARTH created Group 'EARTH'\"\n     - \"EARTH added RAIN\"\n     - \"EARTH added TREES\"\n     - \"EARTH added ANIMALS\"\n     - \"EARTH added MAN\"\n     - \"REST IS HISTORY\"\n     - \"MAN now an ADMIN\"\n     - \"MAN removed ANIMALS\"\n     - \"MAN removed TREES\"\n     - \"RAIN left\"\n\n3. **Bottom Section:**\n   - The bottom section has a light brown background with a pattern of various illustrations.\n   - There are several text boxes with different actions or events listed.\n     - \"MAN now an ADMIN\"\n     - \"MAN removed ANIMALS\"\n     - \"MAN removed TREES\"\n     - \"RAIN left\"\n\n4. **Text:**\n   - The text at the bottom of the image reads \"REST IS HISTORY\" in bold yellow letters.\n\nThe meme humorously depicts a scenario where Earth created a group called \"EARTH\" and added various elements to it, including rain, trees, animals, and a man. However, the man later removed the animals, trees, and rain, leaving only the man as an administrator. The rest of the story is left to the reader's imagination, suggesting that the rest of history is not relevant to the current situation.\n\nOverall, the meme is a playful take on the idea of a group or entity created by Earth and how it changes over time."}
